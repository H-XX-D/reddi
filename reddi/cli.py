    """A modern command-line client for Reddit.

    Built for the launch/monitor workflow: write a post, watch how it's doing,
    reply to comments, and crosspost to the next sub — all from your shell.

    First-time setup:

      \b
      1. Register an "installed app" at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
         (redirect URI: http://localhost:16180/)
      2. reddi auth login --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID
      3. reddi me  # confirm it works

    Common workflows:

      \b
      reddi post --sub SideProject --title "I built X" --body-file post.md
      reddi watch  <post-url>
      reddi inbox list
      reddi comment <comment-url> --body "thanks for trying it!"
      reddi crosspost <post-url> --to MacApps --title "[X] does Y"
