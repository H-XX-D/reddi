# Changelog

All notable changes to `reddi` are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and `reddi` adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-10

The "two surfaces, one CLI" release. reddi now bundles Devvit project management alongside its OAuth API surface, so all your Reddit-platform work lives under one entry point.

### Added

- **`reddi devvit`** command group — wrapper for Reddit's Devvit platform CLI (`npx devvit`). Subcommands:
  - `reddi devvit init [--token TOKEN]` — scaffold a Devvit project into `./devvit/` (or `--dir`). Without a token, runs `npx devvit init` interactively. With a `--token` from <https://developers.reddit.com/new>, uses `npm create devvit@latest <token>` directly.
  - `reddi devvit dev` — runs the Devvit dev server (`npm run dev`)
  - `reddi devvit playtest [SUBREDDIT]` — Devvit's hot-reload-to-real-sub mode
  - `reddi devvit upload` — publish the app to Reddit (`npx devvit upload`)
  - `reddi devvit status` — show project state (exists / package.json / node_modules / version)
- **`--dir PATH`** group-level flag — point at a non-default Devvit project location
- `.gitignore` rules for `devvit/node_modules/`, `devvit/dist/`, `devvit/.devvit/`, `devvit/build/`

### Why this exists

Reddit has two completely separate developer surfaces:
1. **Classic OAuth API** (`/prefs/apps`) — external programs that talk to Reddit. This is reddi's main domain.
2. **Devvit** (`developers.reddit.com`) — apps that run inside Reddit (custom posts, mod tools). TypeScript/React, deployed to Reddit's infrastructure.

A single user often wants both: classic OAuth for launch/monitor workflows, Devvit for in-Reddit features. reddi v1.2 makes reddi the unified entry point. The Python CLI and the Devvit project live in the same repo, managed by the same tool.

### Stability

The v1.0 stability contract holds: no flag shapes or JSON keys changed on existing commands. `reddi devvit` is a new top-level group with its own flags.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-10

Documentation + ergonomics from real first-user setup experience.

### Added

- `reddi auth login --host HOST` — override the OAuth callback host (default still `localhost`). Use `--host 127.0.0.1` when Reddit rejects `localhost` redirect URIs (some account vintages hit a "non-localhost URL" policy check that 127.0.0.1 passes universally).

### Changed

- README "First-time setup" section dramatically expanded into a real walk-through with:
  - **Pre-flight checks** for Reddit account requirements (email verification, account standing, phone verification)
  - **Step-by-step app registration** with screenshot-worthy field-by-field guidance
  - **Comprehensive troubleshooting section** covering the Responsible Builder Policy banner, redirect-URI mismatches, missing "create app" button, and the Devvit-vs-classic-OAuth confusion
  - Recommended default is now `http://127.0.0.1:16180/` instead of `localhost` — universally accepted by Reddit's validator

### Why

A real first-time-user run through Reddit's developer surface in May 2026 revealed multiple non-obvious blockers: the Responsible Builder Policy gate, intermittent localhost rejection, and the Devvit-vs-classic-OAuth surface confusion. The previous setup docs assumed a happy path; this revision documents every gate we actually encountered.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-10

The "efficiency amplifier" release. Five new commands designed around the insight that reddi's value isn't "another Reddit CLI" — it's making the Reddit launch/monitor loop substantially faster than the browser.

### Added

- **`reddi completion <bash|zsh|fish>`** — emit shell completion scripts. After install, `reddi <TAB>` completes commands and `reddi auth <TAB>` completes subcommands. Click 8 native; supports bash, zsh, and fish.
- **`reddi launch <config.json>`** — declarative multi-stage launch orchestration. Describe a launch as JSON (sequence of stages with delays, optional post-launch watch period with shell-command hooks for state changes), and reddi runs the whole sequence. Supports `--dry-run` for plan validation, JSON-lines log file, and `on_removal` / `on_locked` shell-command hooks. The big v1.x feature.
- **`reddi history`** — list your own recent submissions with current vote/comment/removed/locked state. Supports `--sort new|top|hot|controversial` and `--limit`. Pipe to `jq` to filter (e.g., find your removed posts: `reddi history --json | jq '.[] | select(.removed)'`).
- **`reddi inbox watch`** — live-stream new inbox items as they arrive (PRAW long-poll inbox stream). Supports `--mark-read` and `--on-arrival "shell command"` for terminal bell, notifications, or webhooks. Useful during a launch when you want comment replies to surface in real time.
- **`reddi watch --on-removal` / `--on-locked`** — fire a shell command exactly once when a watched post transitions to removed or locked. The post URL is passed via `$REDDI_POST_URL`. Lets you pipe to `osascript`, `notify-send`, Slack webhooks, etc.

### Changed

- User-Agent string bumped to `reddi/1.1 (https://github.com/H-XX-D/reddi)`.
- README rewritten to lead with the efficiency angle. The pitch is no longer "modern Reddit CLI" but "turns the launch loop from 90 minutes of tab-switching into 20 minutes of terminal commands."

### v1.x stability contract

All v1.0 flag shapes and JSON keys remain stable. v1.1 only adds new commands and new flags on existing commands — no breaking changes.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`reddi inbox list`** — list unread (default) or all inbox items: comment replies, mentions, private messages.
- **`reddi inbox mark-read`** — mark items read by `--id` (repeatable) or `--all`.
- **`reddi comment <url-or-id>`** — post a top-level comment on a submission, or reply to a specific comment. Auto-detects which based on URL shape. Supports `--body`, `--body-file`, and `--body -` (stdin). `--dry-run` is supported.
- **`reddi search <query>`** — search posts across all of Reddit or within a sub. Supports `--sort`, `--time`, `--limit`, `--syntax`. Lucene-style queries (`title:foo`, `selftext:bar`, `AND`/`OR`) are the default.
- **`reddi subs list`** — list subscribed subreddits, sorted by subscriber count.
- **`reddi subs info <name>`** — sub metadata: subscribers, active users, type, created date, submission types allowed.
- **`reddi subs subscribe <name>` / `unsubscribe <name>`** — add/remove subscription.
- **`reddi crosspost <url-or-id> --to <sub>`** — crosspost an existing submission to another sub. Supports `--title` override, `--flair-id`, `--flair-text`, NSFW/spoiler overrides, and `--dry-run`.
- **`reddi flairs <sub>`** — list available flair templates for a sub. Use the `--link` (default) / `--user` toggle to switch between post-flair and user-flair templates. The listed `id` is what `reddi post --flair-id` expects.

### Changed

- Bumped to **production/stable** classifier — the v1.0 surface is the stable contract; we won't break these flags or shapes in the 1.x line.
- README rewritten to lead with use case ("the launch/monitor workflow") rather than feature list.
- Top-level `--help` now showcases the launch loop: post → watch → inbox → comment → crosspost.

### Stable contract (v1.0 promise)

These commands and their flag shapes are stable for the entire 1.x line:

```text
reddi auth (login|status|logout)
reddi me
reddi post
reddi status <url-or-id>
reddi watch <url-or-id>
reddi inbox (list|mark-read)
reddi comment <url-or-id>
reddi search <query>
reddi subs (list|info|subscribe|unsubscribe)
reddi crosspost <url-or-id> --to <sub>
reddi flairs <sub>
```

`--json` is supported on every command that returns data, and the JSON shape will not change incompatibly within 1.x.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-10

Initial release.

### Added

- `reddi auth (login|status|logout)` — browser-based OAuth via local callback on port 16180 (chosen to avoid the heavy collisions on 8080/3000/5000).
- `reddi me` — show authenticated account info.
- `reddi post` — submit text or link posts; `--dry-run` for lint-before-submit.
- `reddi status <url-or-id>` — vote/comment/removed-state for a post.
- `reddi watch <url-or-id>` — live-updating dashboard for monitoring a launch.
